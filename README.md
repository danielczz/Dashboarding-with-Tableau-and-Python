## Project Outline

This project is the perfect enabler for **overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States**. In this repository you will find all you need to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program decision making.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. That is the data that we are going to use for data analysis purposes. 

The data is provided on real time and available online.


### **Technology landscape**

1. Python, to provide data analysis: 
[_Python_](https://www.python.org/)

1. Pandas, to provide data analysis on Python: 
[_Pandas_](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

1. Tableau, can help anyone see and understand their data. Connect to almost any database, drag and drop to create visualizations, and share with a click: 
[_Tableau_](https://www.tableau.com/)
